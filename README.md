## Assignment:
Use api's from openweathermap.com to create an app that will take user input and give them the current weather forcast as well as the 5 Day weather forcast for the input city.  It should include Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed and the UV Index.  The UV index background color should change if the index is mild, moderate or high.  Each city that is searched should be saved in local storage and a button should be created below the search box.  The user can click on past searches and retrieve the current data for that city. On reload the last city searched should populate the results div.
